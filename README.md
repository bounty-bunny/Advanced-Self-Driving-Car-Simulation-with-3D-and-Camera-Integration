# Advanced Self-Driving Car Simulation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a 3D self-driving car simulation using Python. The car navigates a 3D environment with simulated camera input for lane-following and obstacle avoidance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pygame
- OpenCV
- PyOpenGL

## Installation
